You can create your home library database by running library.sql in MySQL, PostgreSQL or another RDMS.
With this app you can view, add, rename and delete books from the library.
Tables consist of author's name, book title and genre and sorted by author's id. 
Two tables are referencing by one-to-many relationship, with author's id being the foreign key in books table.

<b>Usage:</b>
Compile Main.java file and then run 'java Main' in your terminal and follow instructions on screen.

<b>Note:</b>
This project I made during learning JDBC component of Java API to demonstrate how Java can connect to the relational 
databases.
